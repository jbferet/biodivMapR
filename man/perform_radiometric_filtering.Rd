\arguments{
\item{Image_Path}{character. Path of the image to be processed}

\item{Mask_Path}{character. Path of the mask corresponding to the image}

\item{Output_Dir}{character. Path for output directory}

\item{TypePCA}{character. Type of PCA: choose either "PCA" or "SPCA"}

\item{NDVI_Thresh}{numeric. NDVI threshold applied to produce a mask (select pixels with NDVI>NDVI_Thresh)}

\item{Blue_Thresh}{numeric. Blue threshold applied to produce a mask (select pixels with Blue refl < Blue_Thresh --> filter clouds) refl expected between 0 and 10000}

\item{NIR_Thresh}{numeric. NIR threshold applied to produce a mask (select pixels with NIR refl > NIR_Thresh) refl expected between 0 and 10000}

\item{Blue}{numeric. central wavelength corresponding to the blue spectral band (in nanometers)}

\item{Red}{numeric. central wavelength corresponding to the red spectral band (in nanometers)}

\item{NIR}{numeric. central wavelength corresponding to the NIR spectral band (in nanometers)}
