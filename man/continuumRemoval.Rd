\title{Computes continuum removal for matrix shaped data: more efficient than
processing individual spectra
the convex hull is based on the computation of the derivative between R at a
given spectral band and R at the following bands}
\usage{
continuumRemoval(Minit, Spectral_Bands, p = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Minit}{numeric. initial data matrix (nb samples x nb bands)}

\item{Spectral_Bands}{numeric. central wavelength for the spectral bands}

\item{p}{list. progressor object for progress bar}
}
\value{
samples from image and updated number of pixels to sampel if necessary
}
