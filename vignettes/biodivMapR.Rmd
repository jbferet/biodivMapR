This tutorial aims at describing the processing workflow and providing a script aiming at producing diversity maps on a Sentinel-2 subset image acquired over the Cameroonese forest. The workflow is divided into three steps:

* Definition of the processing parameters: 

    * input / output files paths
    * output spatial resolution
    * preprocessing and processing options
    
* Computation of the diversity maps. This includes several diversity metrics which can be computed independently:
    * $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversity maps as defined in [Feret & Asner (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1890/13-1824.1 "Feret&Asner2014") and [Feret & de Boissieu (2019)]( https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13310 "Feret&deBoissieu2014")
    * Functional diversity maps, including Richnes, Evenness and Divergence as defined in [Villeger et al. (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1890/07-1206.1 "Villeger2008")
    <!-- * Partitioning of spectral diversity into $\alpha$ and $\beta$ components following an adaptation of the method proposed by [Laliberte et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13429 "Laliberte2020") -->
    
* Validation of the resulting diversity metrics if field plots measurements are available 

The computation of the diversity maps is based on a certain number of prepocessing steps including: 
    * Spectral normalization with continuum removal (relevant if woring with multi or hypersepctral images)
    * dimensionality reduction based on PCA, SPCA or MNF and component selection

Below is the typical flow chart of the computation of diversity maps with __biodivMapR__ :

<!-- ## Partitioning of spectral diversity into $\alpha$ and $\beta$ components -->
<!-- The partitioning of spectral diversity is based on the `specdiv` function provided by [Etienne Laliberte on Github](https://github.com/elaliberte/specdiv "specdiv"). The original method does not use the exact same normalization, and only the framework starting from component selection is used here. Future versions will include the full original framework.  -->
